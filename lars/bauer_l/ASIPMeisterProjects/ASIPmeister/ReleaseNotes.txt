1. Overview
ASIP Meister is an ASIP (Application Specific Instruction Set
Processor) development environment. ASIP Meister generates 
HDL descriptions of processor for simulation and synthesis from
one description named micro operation description. 
Designer can design ASIPs easily by writing micro operations of
each instruction and make large design space exploration of ASIPs.

What is ASIPs?
A: ASIP is the abbreviation of Application Specific Instruction
Set Processor. ASIP may have special instructions for dedicated
applications and can make high performance processing at low
cost hardware.

2. What's new in this release
2003.10.2
- 1.1
This release includes some fixes for previous release.

Modification and BUG fixes information in this release are below.
(1) Control part in HDL generation has been enhanced.

(1.1) Fixed a problem on a substitution of variable reference 
 in micro operation description.
(1.2) Added a fix for a large design.
(1.3) Problems with op-code/operand in instruction type were fixed.

(2) Resource Database (FHM)

(2.1) Register-file model for simulation was fixed.
(2.2) Wire model was fixed.

(3) GUI

Some problems in GUI were fixed. 

(4) User's Manual

Usage of interrupt/exception feature was added to User's manual.

Attention!!:
This version of ASIP Meister can read design data of ASIP Meister
version 1.0, but design data of ASIP Meister before version 1.0 can
not be read in this version.
There is no converter program from previous designs to this version.
Sorry, please input your data again if you need use your previous data.

2003.7.15
- 1.0
This is the first public release of ASIP Meister.

Modification and BUG fixes information in this release are below.
(1) Control part in HDL generation has been enhanced.

Version 1.0 supports maskable/nonmaskable interrupts.

(2) Resource Database (FHM)

VHDL descriptions of registerfile and multiplier were fixed.

(3) Tutorial Document

Tutorial document is included in this version. 

(4) User's Manual

User's manual is included in this version. 

2002.10.31
- 0.9.0
This is the second public beta release of ASIP Meister.

Modification and BUG fixes information in this beta are below.
(1) Control part in HDL generation has been enhanced.

From version 0.9.0, pipeline execution is automatically stalled
in case some structural hazards happen on single-cycle operation unit.

(2) Resource Database (FHM)

(2.1) Adder model VHDL description was fixed.
(2.2) Dmau and imau model are new models. New dmau and imau have more parameters.

(3) Tutorial Document

Preliminary Tutorial document is included in this version. Sorry, the instruction
is still for version 0.8. But usage is almost alike in version 0.9.

2002.07.01
- 0.8.0
This is the first public beta release of ASIP Meister.
This version of ASIP Meister is 0.8.0. 

3. Known bugs

(1) When two or more persons use ASIP Meister on a computer at the
same time, ASIP Meister will not work correctly. It might look corrupted
and generated files will be incorrect.

How to avoid the problem:
Current version of ASIP Meister, there is a limitation that
only one person can use the system at the same time. However
in the near future, this limitation will be removed so that multiple
users can use the system at the same time.

(2) If a conditional execution sentence on a multi-cycle resource
is exist, a generated processor may work incorrectly.

How to avoid this problem:
Do not use a conditional execution sentence on a multi-cycle 
 resource. This problem will be fixed on next release.
